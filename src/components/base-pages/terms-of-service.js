            <h4>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h4>

            <p>Welcome to EPYPE. EPYPE provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be
            updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: https://www.epype.net/terms.
            In addition, when using particular EPYPE services, you and EPYPE shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services,
            which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. If you are a member of an EPYPE
            affiliate company, different terms of service may apply to you. EPYPE also may offer other services from time to time that are governed by different Terms
            of Services.</p>

            <p>EPYPE may use and reserves the right to use an example of the services it provides to you on its website at https://www.epype.net as an example of
            services that can be provided to other clients.</p>

            <h4>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h4>

            <p>EPYPE currently provides users with access to Texting, Integrated Voice Response (IVR) technology, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology,
            streaming audio, audio conferencing, web and IVR messaging, and various communications tools or services. Some of these Services may be privately branded through alliance programs.
            You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for EPYPE to provide the Service.
            You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from EPYPE, such as service announcements, administrative
            messages and the EPYPE Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of EPYPE membership and you will not be able to opt out
            of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new
            EPYPE properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "AS-IS" and that EPYPE assumes no
            responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.
            You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or
            airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition,
            you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service. Please be aware that EPYPE does NOT allow Services that

            <h4>3. PAYMENT PROCESSING AND PRODUCT PURCHASES</h4>

            EPYPE user to properly connect their EPYPE account with their payment processing account. EPYPE will not be held responsible for refunds, loss of profits,
            or inventory management in any way. We are not liable for any purchases made if a product is out of stock or no longer available. Any and all payment conflicts
            between the EPYPE user and their customer are to be handled directly between the EPYPE user and their customer. EPYPE will not facilitate correspondence between
            the EPYPE user and their customer regarding payments of products/services.</p>

            <h4>24. GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>

            <p>The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and EPYPE and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and
            EPYPE. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party
            software. The TOS and the relationship between you and EPYPE shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to its conflict
            of law provisions. You and EPYPE agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Utah, Utah.
            The failure of EPYPE to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
            provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to
            give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. You agree
            that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must
            be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
            The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
